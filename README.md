##### This app is a fun tool for researchers and academics who want to gain insight into the work of a specific author without having to read through countless abstracts. By simply providing the author's name, the app creates a word cloud based on the frequency of words in the abstracts, giving you the opportunity to see the most frequently used words in the author's research, and maybe discover that your favorite author is obsessed with {pizza} or {cat videos} in his/her abstracts.
